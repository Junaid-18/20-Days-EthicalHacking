# 🛡️ Day 2: Cyber Kill Chain, Reconnaissance & Ethical Hacking Phases

## 📌 1. Cyber Kill Chain Methodology

- **Reconnaissance**: Attacker gathers information about the target.
- **Weaponization**: Creation of malicious payload using collected data.
- **Delivery**: Sending the payload (email, USB, website).
- **Exploitation**: Triggering the payload using a system vulnerability.
- **Installation**: Installing malware/backdoor on the system.
- **Command & Control (C2)**: Remote communication/control by attacker.
- **Actions on Objectives**: Final goals like data theft or system takeover.

---

## 🔍 2. Introduction to Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the first step in both the Cyber Kill Chain and Ethical Hacking. It involves gathering intel about the target system.

**Types of Reconnaissance:**
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: No direct interaction (e.g., WHOIS, Google Dorks).
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Direct probing/scanning (e.g., Nmap, traceroute).

---

## 🆚 3. Passive vs Active Reconnaissance

| Feature             | Passive Reconnaissance         | Active Reconnaissance            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | No direct interaction          | Direct interaction with target   |
| **Detection Risk**  | Low                            | High                             |
| **Tools**           | Google Dorking, Whois, Shodan  | Nmap, Netcat, Traceroute         |
| **Data Gathered**   | Public Info (DNS, Email, etc.) | Ports, OS, Services              |

# 🛡️ Day 5 – Subdomain Enumeration and Firewalls Identifiers

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Subdomain Enumeration

- **What is a Subdomain?**  
  A subdomain is a division of a main domain, used to organize or host specific services like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`.

- **Definition of Subdomain Enumeration**  
  Subdomain enumeration is the process of identifying valid subdomains associated with a target domain. It is a crucial part of reconnaissance in ethical hacking as it uncovers potential entry points that are not visible on the main site.

- **Tools Used:**
  - **Subfinder**  
    Command:  
    ```bash
    subfinder -d org.com
    ```
  - **Online Tool**  
    Visit: [https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl)

---

### 🔹 Identifying Firewalls

- **What is a Firewall?**  
  A firewall is a network security system that monitors and filters traffic to and from a network. It helps protect against unauthorized access.

- **Tool Used:**
  - **wafw00f**  
    Command:  
    ```bash
    wafw00f https://org.com
    ```
    If it doesn't work, try:
    ```bash
    sudo wafw00f https://org.com
    ```
  🔎 Note: This tool may successfully detect firewalls for some domains but might fail for others depending on the WAF configuration.

---

## 📝 Observations

- Subdomain enumeration tools like Subfinder and online lookup services are effective in identifying exposed infrastructure.
- Firewall detection is sometimes limited by server-side settings and protection mechanisms.
- These tools are essential in the **Reconnaissance** phase of ethical hacking.

# 🧠 Day 6 – Active Reconnaissance & Nmap Scanning

## 🔍 Topic: Active Reconnaissance
Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with a target system to gather information. Unlike passive reconnaissance, it's **detectable** and **may trigger alerts** on IDS/IPS systems.

**Examples include:**
- Port Scanning
- OS Detection
- Service Enumeration
- Vulnerability Scanning

**Tools used:** Nmap, Netcat, Hping

---

## 📌 What are Ports?
Ports are virtual communication endpoints used to identify specific processes or network services.

| Port | Service         | Use                        |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| 20   | FTP Data         | File transfer               |
| 21   | FTP Command      | FTP control                 |
| 22   | SSH              | Secure shell (remote login) |
| 25   | SMTP             | Email service               |
| 53   | DNS              | Domain name resolution      |
| 80   | HTTP             | Web (non-secure)            |
| 443  | HTTPS            | Web (secure)                |

---

## 🔗 What are Protocols?
- **TCP** – Connection-oriented, reliable
- **UDP** – Connectionless, faster but unreliable

---

## 🛠️ Nmap Tool Overview

Nmap (Network Mapper) is used for:
- Host discovery
- Port scanning
- OS & version detection
- Running vulnerability scripts

### ✅ Command we used:
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -O scanme.nmap.org
sudo nmap -A org.com
```


# 🛡️ Day 7 – Directory Bruteforcing 

---

## 🔍 What is a Directory?

In web applications, a **directory** is like a folder that stores web pages, configuration files, scripts, and other components. Some directories are hidden or not linked publicly, making them vulnerable if they contain sensitive data such as:
- Admin panels
- Backups
- Configuration files

Directory Bruteforcing helps uncover these hidden folders by trying many possible paths using a **wordlist**.

---

## 🛠️ Practical Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Start the Machine
We used the **"Vulnversity"** machine on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), copied the **target IP address**, e.g.:

```bash
http://10.10.188.89
🚀 Tool 1: Gobuster (for HTTP)
🔹 Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.188.89 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
🔹 Explanation:
Flag	Description
dir	Directory brute-force mode
-u	Target URL
-w	Path to the wordlist file

⚠️ If the wordlist path doesn't work, check:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/
Or install Seclists:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install seclists
📄 Sample Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.hta       (Status: 403)
/admin      (Status: 301)
/uploads    (Status: 301)
403: Forbidden – file/folder exists but access is denied.

301: Moved Permanently – folder exists and can be accessed.

🔐 Gobuster HTTPS Limitation
Gobuster may fail with HTTPS URLs due to certificate or SSL issues. That’s why we switch to Feroxbuster for HTTPS scanning.

🚀 Tool 2: Feroxbuster (for HTTPS)
🔹 Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
feroxbuster --url https://10.10.188.89 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
✅ Why Feroxbuster?
Works well with HTTPS

Supports recursion

Automatically handles redirects

Easy and fast

🔧 Install it:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install feroxbuster
📂 Wordlist Location in Kali Linux
To find common wordlists:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/
Or search directly:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo find / -name "common.txt" 2>/dev/null

🧠 Summary
Tool	Protocol	Usage Purpose	Wordlist Path
Gobuster	HTTP	Fast directory bruteforcing	/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
Feroxbuster	HTTPS	Secure brute-forcing	/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```
